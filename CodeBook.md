##CODEBOOK

This data set contains the result of cleaning and rearranging process of "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It is best visualized in the R software through the "read.table" and "View" function, and it contains 180 observations for 81 variables. The values of each variable in this data set, is the calculated mean values per subject (experiment volunteers) and activity, that derive from mean and standard deviation values (see decription bellow) of features measured from an accelerometer and gyroscope as presented in a smartwatch.

This data set has been cleaned and rearranged in a way that each row represents the average inertial measurement unit (IMU) for each activity and each subject and for each values of all variables from the original dataset that contained the substring "mean" or "std".
